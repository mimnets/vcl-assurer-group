# Architecture Decision Records

One file per significant, hard-to-reverse decision: `ADR-NNNN-short-title.md`, numbered
sequentially and never renumbered.

| ADR | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [ADR-0001](./ADR-0001-cms-platform-and-starter.md) | CMS platform and starting point | Accepted 2026-10-19 |
| [ADR-0002](./ADR-0002-database-strategy.md) | Database and media storage strategy | Accepted 2026-10-19 (PostgreSQL conditional) |
| [ADR-0003](./ADR-0003-corporate-content-model.md) | Corporate content model | Accepted 2026-10-20 |

## Lifecycle

`Proposed` → `Accepted` (by a named human approver, with date) → optionally `Superseded by
ADR-NNNN` or `Deprecated`. Accepted ADRs are not edited in substance. To change a decision, write a
new ADR that supersedes the old one, and update the old one's status line only.
