# D-DB-5 follow-up proposal: PostgreSQL connection loss crashes the app

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | **Proposal** (`m1-011`, 2026-10-20). D-DB-5 stays **OPEN**. Nothing here has been run against PostgreSQL in m1-011; no fix is claimed. |
| **Decision** | D-DB-5 (open) · D-DB-6 (Option B: PostgreSQL for development and testing only) |
| **Proposed task** | The next free task ID when it starts (expected `m1-012` or later; WS-4 form operations may take `m1-012` first) |
| **Evidence** | [m1-010 report, D15b](../engineering/reports/2026/10/2026-10-20-m1-010-postgresql-compatibility-acceptance.report.md) · [m1-011 report](../engineering/reports/2026/10/2026-10-20-m1-011-security-hardening.report.md) |

## 1. Verified facts (m1-011)

- Installed: `@apostrophecms/db-connect` **1.1.0** (latest on npm), `pg` 8.23.1, `pg-pool` 3.14.0.
  The upstream source is the `apostrophecms/apostrophe` monorepo, `packages/db-connect`. Its
  `main` branch is also 1.1.0, and `adapters/postgres.js` is identical in the relevant part.
- `adapters/postgres.js` (1.1.0) creates its pools with `new Pool({ connectionString, ...options })`
  in three places: the main pool, the temporary `/postgres` admin pool used for
  `CREATE DATABASE`, and the reconnect pool. **None of them gets an `'error'` listener.** The
  cursor implementation also holds a checked-out client (`this._cursorClient`) across `FETCH`
  calls without a client `'error'` listener.
- node-postgres contract (installed `pg-pool` README and `index.js`): an idle client that loses
  its connection emits `'error'` through the pool (`idleListener` → `pool.emit('error', err,
  client)`). The README says to "attach an error handler to the pool" for this case. Without a
  listener, Node treats it as an unhandled `'error'` event and the process exits. That matches
  the m1-010 stack (`read ECONNRESET` from `idleListener`).
- Upstream search (GitHub issue search over `apostrophecms/apostrophe`, open and closed: "pool
  error", "ECONNRESET", "pg-pool", "postgres crash", "db-connect"): **no matching issue**.
  #5024 "issue with postgres" is an unrelated MongoDB connection question.
- Supported configuration offers no hook. `@apostrophecms/db` passes only its `connect` option
  and `adapters` to `dbConnect`, and `pg`'s `Pool` options have no error-handler setting.
  Attaching a listener from the project would mean reaching into the private
  `apos.dbClient._pool` field.

## 2. Upstream issue (ready to paste; not filed)

No authorized integration was available in m1-011 (`gh` is not installed and no token was used),
and the owner has not approved the public text. The owner (or an approved integration) can file
this at <https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe/issues/new>.

> **Title:** db-connect (postgres): process exits when PostgreSQL drops an idle pooled connection — no `error` listener on the pg Pool
>
> **Versions:** apostrophe 4.34.0, @apostrophecms/db-connect 1.1.0, pg 8.23.1, pg-pool 3.14.0, Node 24.21.0, PostgreSQL 16.15.
>
> **What happens.** With `APOS_DB_URI=postgres://…`, if PostgreSQL closes a connection that is idle in the pool (server restart, failover, `pg_terminate_backend`, a proxy or firewall idle timeout, a network drop), the Node process exits:
>
> ```
> node:events:… throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event
> Error: read ECONNRESET
>     at … (pg-pool/index.js) idleListener
> ```
>
> **Expected.** The app logs the error and keeps running. The pool discards the dead client and opens a new connection on the next query once the database is back, as the MongoDB adapter does.
>
> **Cause.** `packages/db-connect/adapters/postgres.js` creates `new Pool(...)` (main pool, the temporary admin pool used for `CREATE DATABASE`, and the reconnect pool) without `pool.on('error', …)`. node-postgres documents that idle clients emit errors through the pool and that an error listener is required; without one, Node treats the event as an unhandled `'error'` and exits. A checked-out cursor client (`_cursorClient`) has the same exposure while it is held between `FETCH` calls.
>
> **Reproduction (minimal).**
> 1. Start an Apostrophe 4.34.0 project with `APOS_DB_URI=postgres://user:pass@127.0.0.1:5432/db` and load a page, so the pool holds idle connections.
> 2. While the app is idle, stop PostgreSQL abruptly (`pg_ctl stop -m immediate`). We reproduced it this way, deterministically. `SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'db' AND pid <> pg_backend_pid();` should take the same path, but we have not tested it.
> 3. The Node process exits with the stack above.
>
> **Suggested fix.** Attach `pool.on('error', (err) => { /* log via the adapter's logger */ })` to every pool `connect()` creates. Attach a client `'error'` listener to the cursor's checked-out client for as long as it is held (release it with the error so the pool destroys it). Add a test that terminates the backend connections and then runs a query.
>
> **Impact.** Availability only, with no data loss observed (PostgreSQL recovered via WAL, and the last acknowledged write survived). But any database restart, failover or idle-connection timeout kills every app process.

## 3. Mitigation options

| Option | Supported? | Effect | Validation needed | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A. Process supervisor** with automatic restart (systemd `Restart=always` + `RestartSec=2`, Docker `restart: unless-stopped`, or the platform's equivalent) | Yes; no code | Recovers within startup time (seconds with a prebuilt release). Requests in flight fail; sessions survive (they are in the database) | Kill the database, confirm the app restarts and serves once the database is back | **Required** for any shared PostgreSQL environment until upstream fixes it |
| **B. Health checks** at the load balancer or orchestrator | Yes; a probe on `GET /` works today | Takes the instance out of rotation while it restarts; with ≥2 instances, no visible outage for the other instance's users | Same disconnect test, with two instances | Required with A. A lightweight database-checking health route is a separate small proposal, if `GET /` proves too heavy |
| **C. Upstream fix** (§2) | Yes, once released | Removes the crash | Re-run m1-010 D15b and the §4 test on the fixed release | File the issue; track releases |
| **D. Project-level listener** on `apos.dbClient._pool` from a project module | **No.** It relies on a private field, the cursor client is not covered, and it breaks silently if the internals change | Prevents the idle-client crash only | Full §4 test; re-check on every db-connect release | Not recommended. Consider only if C stalls and the owner accepts the maintenance risk |
| Global `uncaughtException` handler, or patching `node_modules` | Forbidden (m1-011 prompt) | — | — | Rejected |
| MongoDB fallback | Yes (ADR-0002) | Its driver reconnects | — | Stays the fallback if C does not land before staging |

## 4. Validation test (proposed follow-up task)

Gate: the owner approves a disposable PostgreSQL again. In m1-010 the binaries were unsigned EDB
zips, accepted for that test only. A container or WSL distribution would be preferable, if one
can be approved.

1. A fresh database, the app under a supervisor (A), two instances behind a local health-checked
   proxy (B).
2. `pg_terminate_backend` on all app connections while idle → record exit or no exit, restart
   time, failed requests.
3. `pg_ctl stop -m immediate`, then start after 30 s → the same measurements.
4. A long cursor iteration interrupted mid-way.
5. On an upstream release with the fix: repeat 2–4 **without** the supervisor; it must not exit.

D-DB-5 closes only after step 5 passes on a released db-connect version, or the owner explicitly
accepts A+B as the permanent mitigation after steps 2–4 pass.
