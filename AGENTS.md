# AGENTS.md — VCL-ASSURER-GROUP

Assurer World website on ApostropheCMS Community Edition, derived from
starter-kit-essentials. Project-specific rules come first; the starter kit's
conventions follow and still apply.

## Engineering rules (binding for humans and AI agents)

These rules govern all work in this repository. Process detail lives in
`docs/engineering/STANDARDS.md` and `docs/engineering/git-and-ci.md`; decisions
in `docs/architecture/decisions/`. If a request conflicts with a rule, stop and ask.

### Scope and change policy
- **Minimal change.** Do what the task asks, nothing more. No opportunistic refactors,
  renames or reformatting of unrelated code. Match surrounding style.
- **Official Apostrophe APIs first.** Use pages, pieces, widgets, schema fields, the query
  builder, the REST API, `@apostrophecms/migration` and core tasks before writing anything
  custom. Read the installed source in `node_modules/apostrophe` when docs are unclear.
- **No unapproved dependencies.** Adding, removing or major-upgrading a package needs explicit
  human approval, a license check, and an advisory check (GitHub advisories + `npm audit`).
- **Community Edition only.** Never add `@apostrophecms-pro/*` or Assembly modules, and never
  design around Pro-only features without an approved ADR.

### Data and database safety (see ADR-0002)
- Content is accessed only through Apostrophe APIs. **No ORM, no parallel CMS database, no raw
  SQL** for content operations.
- **Never** run `apos-db-restore`, drop or delete collections, or point the app at a
  non-local database without explicit approval. Restore is destructive. Restore into a
  new, empty database only.
- Schema/data changes ship as `@apostrophecms/migration` migrations that are idempotent and
  tested on a copy first. Back up (database **and** media) before running them anywhere shared.
- Every site has its own database, media store and secrets. Never copy one site's database
  into another.

### Security by default
- **No secrets in source, docs, reports, commit messages or test fixtures.** Secrets live in
  `.env` (git-ignored) or the platform secret store. Database dumps are secrets.
- New endpoints, forms and uploads need server-side validation, size limits and an
  authorization check. Keep `127.0.0.1` binding and the required `APOS_SESSION_SECRET`.
- Never paste session transcripts, tool output containing tokens, or personal data into
  tracked files.

### Testing before completion
- Before reporting work as done, run `npm run lint`, `npm run test:smoke`,
  `npm run test:workflow` and `npm run test:persistence` (server running; test
  credentials are read from the git-ignored `.env`).
  Report the **actual** results, including failures and anything not verified.

### Browser acceptance testing (added m0-008)
Automated suites call the API as admin. They do not prove that the UI works for real editors.
Each task's report includes a browser checklist (see `docs/engineering/STANDARDS.md`).
1. **Use the authorized Chrome extension** (Claude in Chrome) for end-to-end UI checks where the
   task touches anything a user sees or does. Local hosts only, unless the owner approves otherwise.
2. **Run the relevant browser checks at the end of every completed feature or phase**, after the
   automated suites. Docs-only tasks run a short smoke check of the public site.
3. **Test normal editor capabilities as a non-administrator.** Create a disposable account with the
   supported `node app @apostrophecms/user:add <name> editor` task. Use admin only for admin-only
   features.
4. **Use real UI interactions**: clicks, typing, uploads, drag or arrows, publish. An HTTP status
   or a visible control is not a pass on its own.
5. **Check desktop, tablet and mobile layouts** (about 1440, 768 and 375 px) when layout or
   templates change. Check for horizontal overflow.
6. **For content changes, check draft/published isolation and access**: a draft is not public, a
   published change is, an unpublished edit stays hidden, and logged-out users get no draft or
   user data.
7. **Capture sanitized evidence when it helps**, such as screenshots under `evidence/<task-id>/`
   (git-ignored). No passwords, tokens, personal data or unrelated tabs in frame.
8. **Keep browser credentials, sessions and sensitive screenshots out of Git**, reports and chat.
   Keep test passwords in a scratch file outside the repository, or in `.env`.
9. **Record each check as PASS, FAIL, BLOCKED or NOT TESTED**, with steps, the actual result and
   evidence. Never record an expected result as an actual one.
10. **Agent-executed acceptance is not human approval.** Label agent runs as agent-executed.
    Business and usability approval comes only from a named human, recorded in the repository.
11. **Clean up afterwards**: archive disposable test content and accounts through supported
    Apostrophe UI, REST API or tasks. Never touch other people's content or accounts; never
    hard-delete data. Record whatever is left over.
12. **If Chrome is unavailable, stop and report it.** Mark the browser checks BLOCKED, and do not
    swap in another tool without the owner's approval or claim browser tests that did not run.

### Records
- Each task has an ID (`mN-NNN`), a prompt
  (`docs/engineering/prompts/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD-mN-NNN-*.prompt.md`) and a report
  (`docs/engineering/reports/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD-mN-NNN-*.report.md`), indexed in
  `docs/engineering/INDEX.md`. Never rewrite historical reports or invent past prompts.

### Sessions and context (Claude Code and other agents)
- Start a **new session at every new milestone**, and for any materially different task once
  the earlier context no longer helps.
- At the start of every session, read this file, the ADRs relevant to the task, the latest
  reports in `docs/engineering/INDEX.md`, and the Git state (branch, uncommitted changes,
  `origin/main`).
- The repository documents are the source of truth. Do not rely on an earlier conversation's
  context; if something matters, it must be in a tracked document.
- Archive each task's prompt and a sanitized report under the ISO-date naming convention
  (Records, below). Never archive raw transcripts or tool output containing secrets.
- Finish each milestone with an explicit handoff document and an instruction to start a fresh
  session for the next milestone.

### Git and approvals
- Work on short-lived branches (`<type>/mN-NNN-description`); merge to protected `main` by
  pull request only. Commit messages follow Conventional Commits.
- **No commits, pushes, merges, tags, deployments or GitHub setting changes without explicit
  human approval for that action.** Never rewrite published history or force-push.
- **Architecture gates need explicit human approval:** accepting an ADR, changing database
  engine or storage, adding dependencies, anything touching production, and starting a new
  milestone. Stop and wait at each gate.
- Never modify production systems, mimPortal, or the existing WordPress site or database.

### Project conventions
- Project modules use the `assurer-` prefix (`modules/assurer-*`); core overrides live
  under `modules/@apostrophecms/<module>/`.
- Page-or-URL links use `linkFields()` / `linkHref()` from `lib/link.js`. Page-level `main`
  areas use `lib/area.js`.
- Demo content is seeded by `node app assurer-demo:seed` and is always labelled "Demo".

## Architecture

ApostropheCMS 4 project using ES modules (`"type": "module"`). Modules live in `modules/`,
shared field config in `lib/`, **JSX templates** in `views/` and `modules/*/views/`. Asset
pipeline uses `@apostrophecms/vite`; client-side source is in `modules/asset/ui/src/`.

This project is **fully converted from Nunjucks to JSX**. Write new templates as `.jsx`. Nunjucks
remains fully supported by Apostrophe core and the two interoperate — see
[JSX/Nunjucks Interop](#jsxnunjucks-interop) for the one hard rule.

JSX here is **server-side rendering only** — no React, no virtual DOM, no client runtime. It's an
alternate template syntax evaluated where Nunjucks would have run, implemented by Apostrophe core
itself (`apostrophe/modules/@apostrophecms/template/lib/jsx*.js`). No `react`/`react-dom` package.

## Dev Commands

```
npm run dev      # start with nodemon (watches modules/, lib/, views/, incl. .jsx)
npm start        # start without watch
npm run build    # production asset build
npm run serve    # production server
```

## Anatomy of a JSX Template

Default-export a function taking `(data, helpers)`:

```jsx
export default function ({ page }, { Area }) {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{page.title}</h1>
      <Area doc={page} name="main" />
    </>
  );
}
```

- **`data`** — same object as `data.*` in Nunjucks. Destructure it; write `page.title`, not
  `data.page.title`.
- **`helpers`** — `{ apos, helpers, Area, Component, Extend, Template, Widget, __t }` (below).
- May be `async` if the template itself needs to fetch something first; Apostrophe awaits all
  output regardless, so async children don't require it.

## The Second Argument

| Name | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `apos` | The real `self.apos`. Call any module method directly. **Prefer this.** |
| `helpers` | Nunjucks-oriented helper wrappers — use only when you need a Nunjucks helper's exact behavior. |
| `Area` | Renders an area. Replaces `{% area %}` |
| `Component` | Invokes an async component. Replaces `{% component %}` |
| `Template` | Renders another template, **include semantics** (props arrive as data). Replaces `{% include %}` |
| `Extend` | Renders another template, **extends semantics** — props become `{% block %}` overrides against a `.html` target. Replaces `{% extends %}` |
| `__t` | Localization helper — same `req.t` as Nunjucks's `__t` global. Not on `data` or `helpers`. |

`Widget` also exists, for the rare case of reimplementing `area.html` itself — see the
[JSX templates guide](https://apostrophecms.com/docs/guide/jsx-templates.html) rather than reaching for it from this brief.

## Nunjucks → JSX Gotchas

Full Nunjucks-to-JSX mapping in the
[JSX templates guide](https://apostrophecms.com/docs/guide/jsx-templates.html). Things that
guide won't warn you about:

- No `key`/`ref` — there's no client reconciler. Don't add them, even inside `.map()`.
- `style` accepts a **plain string**, unlike React (`` style={`background-image: url(${url})`} ``).
- Templates are real JS modules — `import` helpers, define extra components in the same file.
- Only the default export receives `helpers`. Inline/imported components are plain functions —
  pass `apos`, `Area`, `__t` etc. in as explicit props, under their own names (`__t={__t}`).

## Adding a Widget

Standard Apostrophe widget setup — see the
[custom widgets guide](https://apostrophecms.com/docs/guide/custom-widgets.html). The one
difference here: write the template as `.jsx`.

```jsx
// modules/card-widget/views/widget.jsx
export default function ({ widget }, { Area }) {
  return (
    <div className="widget card-widget">
      <Area doc={widget} name="contentRT" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Adding a Page Type

Standard Apostrophe page type setup — see the
[pages and page types guide](https://apostrophecms.com/docs/guide/pages.html). Two differences
here: write the template as `.jsx`, and it extends the site layout by passing named slots as
props instead of using `{% block %}`:

```jsx
// modules/default-page/views/page.jsx
export default function ({ page }, { Extend, Area }) {
  return (
    <Extend templateName="layout.jsx" main={<Area doc={page} name="main" />} />
  );
}
```

## Template Discovery

Apostrophe discovers templates by filename — no registry required.

| Template type | Path convention |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Widget | `modules/<widget-name>/views/widget.jsx` |
| Page | `modules/<page-type>/views/page.jsx` |
| Piece index | `modules/<piece-page>/views/index.jsx` |
| Piece show | `modules/<piece-page>/views/show.jsx` |

Lookup tries `.jsx`, `.njk`, then `.html` per directory, nearest module directory first — a
project-level `page.jsx` beats a core-level `page.html`. A `.jsx`/`.njk`/`.html` suffix in a
`templateName` is a starting point, not a constraint: all three extensions are still tried.

## JSX/Nunjucks Interop

> **A `.html` template cannot `{% extends %}`/`{% include %}`/`{% import %}` a `.jsx` template.**
> The reverse (JSX consuming Nunjucks, incl. `<Extend>` block overrides) is fully supported.

This includes `.html` templates inside `node_modules`: core's `@apostrophecms/page/views/notFound.html`
extends `layout.html`, so a JSX layout breaks every 404 page unless shadowed — which is why
`modules/@apostrophecms/page/views/notFound.jsx` exists. Don't delete it.

This project has no other `.html` overrides; core's `@apostrophecms/template/views/outerLayout.html`
is used as-is, and `views/layout.jsx` extends it directly via
`<Extend templateName={data.outerLayout} … />`.

## Template Inheritance

```
outerLayoutBase.html  ← ApostropheCMS core (never edit)
  outerLayout.html    ← core default; override in modules/@apostrophecms/template/views/ only for <head>/meta changes
    views/layout.jsx  ← edit for site chrome (header, nav, footer)
      modules/<page-type>/views/page.jsx ← edit for page content
```

No named blocks in JSX — markup the parent renders is passed as props, plus the implicit
`children` prop for anything between the opening/closing tags.

## Data Sources in Templates

Available on the first function argument. Destructure what you need.

| Variable | Contents | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| `widget` | Widget document | Widget templates only |
| `page` | Current page document | All page templates |
| `piece` | Current piece document | Piece-type page templates only |
| `global` | Global settings document | Requires `@apostrophecms/global` |
| `user` | Authenticated user or `null` | All templates |
| `home` | Home page document | All templates |
| `query` | Query string as object | All templates |
| `outerLayout` | Resolves the correct outer layout | Handles full-page vs AJAX |
| `contextOptions` | Context options passed by the enclosing area | Widget templates |
| `children` | Markup passed between a caller's tags | Templates used as layouts |

## `_` Prefix Convention

Relationship fields are prefixed with `_` (e.g., `_linkPage`, `_author`).
- Value is always an **array**, even with `max: 1`
- Not stored in the document — joined at query time
- Access single results via `doc._field[0]`

## Shared Field Utilities (`lib/`)

| File | Exports | Use for |
|------|---------|---------|
| `lib/area.js` | Default widget config object | Area field `widgets` option |
| `lib/link.js` | `linkFields(condition)`, `linkHref(item)` | Page-or-URL link fields |

```js
import areaConfig from '../../lib/area.js';
// then: options: { widgets: areaConfig }
```

## i18n Key Convention

All project translation strings use the `project:` namespace.

- Key format: `'project:camelCaseKey'` (e.g., `'project:linkText'`)
- Translation files: `modules/@apostrophecms/i18n/i18n/project/<locale>.json`
- Register namespace: `modules/@apostrophecms/i18n/index.js` → `i18n: { project: { browser: true } }`
